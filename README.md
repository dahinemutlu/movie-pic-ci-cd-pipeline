# Design and Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

A web application that is a catalog of Movie Picture movies is comprised of two applications:

- A frontend UI built written in Typescript, using the React framework.
- A backend API written in Python using the Flask framework.

This project aims to design and implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate the development team's workflows for this application. Therefore, we will take the following steps.

- Create GitHub Actions workflows that performs the necessary Continuous Integration steps on the frontend and backend applications:
  - lint
  - build
  - test
- Create the necessary AWS resources/infrastructure with Terraform.
- Create GitHub Actions workflows so that the pipeline deploys the frontend and backend apps to the Kubernetes cluster.
